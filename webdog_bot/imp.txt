🐶 Project Name: WebDog

The Tagline: "The Watchdog for Freelancers. Know when your client breaks their own site."
1. The Core Concept

WebDog is a lightweight Telegram Bot designed specifically for Web Developers and Agencies. Unlike standard "Uptime Monitors" (which only tell you if a server is dead), WebDog monitors the code changes on a live website.

It answers the question: "Did the client try to edit the website code and break the layout?"
2. The Target Audience (Your Customers)

    The Freelancer: Has 5-10 clients on WordPress/Shopify. Clients constantly install random plugins or edit theme files, breaking the site.

    The Small Agency: Manages 50 sites. Needs to know if a site has been hacked or defaced immediately.

    The SEO Specialist: Needs to know if a client accidentally deleted the Google Analytics tag or Meta Descriptions.

3. The "Pain" You Solve

    The Blame Game: When a site breaks, clients blame the dev. WebDog gives the dev proof: "You changed the header.php file at 3:00 PM. That is why it broke."

    Reputation Protection: The dev can catch the error before the client's customers see it.

4. How It Works (The "WebDog" Logic)

We keep it stupidly simple to keep costs at $0.

    Registration: User starts the bot (/start).

    Add Site: User sends /watch https://client-site.com.

    The Snapshot: WebDog visits the site and creates a "Fingerprint" (MD5 Hash) of the webpage's HTML.

    The Patrol: Every 30 minutes (Free) or 5 minutes (Paid), WebDog visits the site again.

        If Status 500/404: Sends "🔴 DOWN Alert"

        If Fingerprint changes: Sends "⚠️ CHANGE Alert"

    The Alert: The user gets a message on Telegram:

        🐶 WebDog Alert Site: https://www.google.com/search?q=client-site.com Event: Content Changed (20% difference) Time: 14:30 PM Check now before the client complains!

5. Feature List (MVP - Version 1.0)

This is what we will build this weekend.

    [Core] Telegram Bot Interface (No website needed).

    [Core] /add [url] command to start monitoring.

    [Core] /list command to see all monitored sites.

    [Core] Background Worker: Checks URLs every 15 minutes.

    [Core] "Diff Checker": Compares current HTML vs. Previous HTML.

    [Smart Feature] "Ignore Dynamic Bits": We must strip out things like "CSRF Tokens" or "Visitor Count" numbers so the bot doesn't send false alarms every second.

6. The "Money Model" (Freemium)

    Free Tier: Monitor 1 URL. Checks every 60 minutes.

    Pro Tier ($1/month or ₹499 Lifetime):

        Monitor 10 URLs.

        Checks every 5 minutes.

        "Smart Ignore" (Ignores ads/popups).

        Payment Link inside the bot (Razorpay/Gumroad).

7. Why This Beats the Giants?

    VisualPing: Sends emails (Slow). WebDog sends Telegram DMs (Instant).

    UptimeRobot: Only checks "Is it alive?". WebDog checks "Did it change?".

    Cost: Running this costs you $0 on a free tier server. Every $1 you make is 100% profit.
